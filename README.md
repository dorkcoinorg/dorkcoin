Dorkcoin
=====================================

What is Dorkcoin?
----------------

Dorkcoin is a playful memecoin built for the internet’s proud misfits — the Real Dorks. It runs on its own blockchain and uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, meaning the network is secured by users who stake their coins instead of mining.

For more information about Dorkcoin itself, see https://dorkcoin.org.

What is Dork Core?
----------------

Dork Core is the name of open source software which enables the use of Dorkcoin. It takes Dorkcoin to the next level by building upon
Bitcoin Core 0.13.2 with some patches from newer Bitcoin Core versions to offer performance enhancements, wider compatibility with third party services and a more advanced base.

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/dorkcore/dorkcoin/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Dorkcoin.

Change log can be found in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).


Testing
-------

Testing and code review might be the bottleneck for development. Please help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](/doc/unit-tests.md) for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: `make check`

There are also [regression and integration tests](/qa) of the RPC interface, written
in Python, that are run automatically on the build server.
These tests can be run (if the [test dependencies](/qa) are installed) with: `qa/pull-tester/rpc-tests.py`

The Travis CI system makes sure that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and OS X, and that unit/sanity tests are run automatically.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.

Branches
-------

### develop
The develop branch is typically used by developers as the main branch for integrating new features and changes into the codebase.
Pull requests should always be made to this branch (except for critical fixes), and might possibly break the code.
The develop branch is considered an unstable branch, as it is constantly updated with new code, and it may contain bugs or unfinished features. It is not guaranteed to work properly on any system.

### master
The master branch gets latest updates from the stable branch.
However, it may contain experimental features and should be used with caution.

### 13.2
The release branch for Dorkcoin 13.2.x. It is intended to contain stable and functional code that has been thoroughly tested and reviewed.

### 25.x
The release branch for Dorkcoin 25.x. Contains functional but experimental code.

### 26.x
The release branch for Dorkcoin 26.x. Contains functional but highly experimental code.
